# The "Flightgear-Arduino-Project

The goal: Build a real Autopilot that is connected to Flightgear!

## The idea

The autopilot panel is controlled by an Arduino Mega board which communicates to a Java Client
via Serial (USB).

The Java Client will communicate to FG via HTTP properties protocol.

Every step during development will be documented within the project wiki.
